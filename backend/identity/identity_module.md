# Identity Module – Design & Implementation

This document focuses on the **implementation of the Identity module** and its core functioning within the Aureon system.

The Identity module is responsible for **who a user is**, **how they are authenticated**, and **what they are authorized to do**, while remaining isolated from infrastructure details.

---

# Goals

* **Authentication**
  Verify user identity (e.g. username/password) and manage authentication tokens.

* **Authorization**
  Determine whether a user has a specific permission to perform an action.

* **User Management**
  Create, update, retrieve, and delete users while enforcing identity-level rules.

---

# Design Philosophy

The Identity module follows **hexagonal (port–adapter) principles**, adapted to the existing Aureon architecture.

* The **Backend Identity layer** contains the core logic.
* The **DataProvider layer** acts as the infrastructure boundary.
* The **API layer** consumes identity services without knowing implementation details.

Each identity file uses a **lightweight Port & Adapter approach**:

* A **Port** defines the contract used by the core and API layer.
* An **Adapter** implements the port and delegates to DataProviders or infrastructure.

This approach:

* Improves modularity
* Reduces coupling
* Limits failure propagation
* Allows future replacement without refactoring core logic

### Module Structure

```
backend/identity/
├── auth.py          # Authentication logic
├── user.py          # User lifecycle management
├── role.py          # Role definitions and mappings
└── permission.py    # Authorization checks
```

Each file contains:

* One **Port**
* One **Adapter**

---

## Authentication (`auth.py`)

### Responsibility

* Verify user credentials
* Issue and validate authentication tokens

### AuthenticationPort

Defines the required authentication capabilities:

* Credential verification
* Token issuance
* Token validation

The port communicates:

* Downward with DataProviders (indirectly)
* Upward with the API layer

### AuthenticationAdapter

Implements authentication using:

* User DataProvider
* Password hashing logic
* Token mechanism (e.g. JWT)

The adapter is isolated and can be replaced without affecting callers.

---

## User Management (`user.py`)

### Responsibility

* Create, update, retrieve, and delete users
* Enforce identity constraints (e.g. unique username)

### UserManagementPort

Defines:

* User lifecycle operations
* Identity-level rules

It does **not** depend on database models or frameworks.

### UserManagementAdapter

Implements persistence by delegating to:

* User DataProvider
* Database session logic (via middleware)

---

## Roles (`role.py`)

### Responsibility

* Define roles
* Map roles to permissions

### RolePort

Defines:

* Role retrieval
* Role-to-permission relationships

### RoleAdapter

Implements role logic using:

* Role DataProvider
* RBAC-style mappings

This design allows future evolution to more advanced policy models.

---

## Authorization (`permission.py`)

### Responsibility

* Decide whether a user is allowed to perform an action

### AuthorizationPort

Defines:

* Permission checks based on user identity

### AuthorizationAdapter

Implements authorization by:

* Resolving user roles
* Resolving role permissions
* Returning allow/deny decisions

Authorization remains **read-only** and stateless.

## Data Flow

```
API Layer
   ↓
Identity Port
   ↓
Identity Adapter
   ↓
DataProvider
   ↓
Database
```

Key rule:

* **Core identity logic never depends on database or framework details**

---

## Error Handling

* Identity-specific errors are raised inside the identity module
* Infrastructure errors are translated at the adapter boundary
* No raw database errors propagate to the API layer

---

## Future Extensions (Out of Scope)

* OAuth / SSO authentication adapters
* Multi-factor authentication
* External identity providers
* Identity service extraction

These can be added without breaking existing interfaces.

---

## Final Principle

**Identity is authority.
Authority must be isolated, explicit, and stable.**
